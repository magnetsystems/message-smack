The dev artifactory (dev-repo.magnet.com:8081) has been shut down
since 10/2017.  Now the deployment will push the artifacts to public
artifactory (repo.magnet.com) directly.

The public artifactory requires a production ${releaseUser} and
${releasePassword} account from (~/.gradle/gradle.properties.)
Hint: yuan.zhi@magnet.com and magnet WiFi password

Make sure to use Gradle 2.13 or above.

To build:
gradle build
